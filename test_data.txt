Chiang Mai is an excellent base for a one-week hiking trip in northern Thailand, offering access to mountains, forests, waterfalls, and national parks. A good starting point is a short warm-up hike along the Monk’s Trail to Wat Pha Lat, a peaceful forest temple near the city with scenic views, and hikers can continue up to Doi Suthep if they want a longer walk. One of the highlights of the week is Doi Inthanon National Park, located about two hours from Chiang Mai, where visitors can hike the Kew Mae Pan Nature Trail, explore Ang Ka Nature Trail, and visit famous waterfalls such as Wachirathan and Siriphum while enjoying the cool mountain climate. For experienced hikers, Chiang Dao Mountain north of Chiang Mai offers a challenging guided summit hike with panoramic views and alpine scenery, and many travelers stay overnight in Chiang Dao village to recover. After the strenuous climb, lighter activities such as visiting Chiang Dao Cave, walking through local villages, or relaxing in hot springs provide a good recovery day. Another scenic hiking area is Mae Kampong, a small mountain village east of Chiang Mai known for forest trails, waterfalls, coffee shops, and a slow-paced lifestyle surrounded by lush greenery. South of Chiang Mai, Ob Khan National Park features canyon and river trails, while Pha Chor offers unusual erosion formations suitable for moderate half-day hikes. On the final day, hikers can choose easy nature walks around Huay Tung Tao Lake, explore the Queen Sirikit Botanic Garden skywalk, or relax in the city before departure. This itinerary works best from November to February when temperatures are cooler, although some trails may be closed during the rainy season.
